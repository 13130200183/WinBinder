Q: How to get a more modern look and feel, instead of the default Windows XP style?
A: You need a manifest file. Either create a manifest file next to your php.exe (called php.exe.manifest) or add the manifest file to php.exe

Q: Where to get a manifest file?
A: A ready-to-use template is available in the root folder of this repository, called 'php.exe.manifest'

Q: When I do not want to have the manifest file next to my php.exe, can I add it somehow to php.exe directly?
A: Yes, you can do so with the free program "Resource Hacker".
  1. Open your php.exe in Resource Hacker
  2. Select Action > Add a new resource from the menu
  3. Select the manifest file you want to add to php.exe
  4. Set the Resource Type to 24, Resource Name to 1 and Resource Language to 1033
  5. Save php.exe
  6. Restart your WinBinder App to see the results
