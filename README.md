WinBinder
=========

WinBinder - The native Windows binding for PHP

What is WinBinder?
==================

WinBinder is a PHP extension written in C, that allows you to build native 
client-side applications for the Windows Platform in pure PHP.

What is needed to start building WinBinder applications?
========================================================

You will need PHP 5.3/5.4 plus the WinBinder matching your PHP version.

How to get the WinBinder extension?
===================================

- use one of the *.dlls in the binaries subfolder
- compile it yourself

How to compile the WinBinder extension?
=======================================

Prerequisites:
--------------
  - get a version of Visual Studio (this how to refers to Visual Studio 2008 Professional)
  - get the PHP binaries you want to use with WinBinder, e.g. VC9 x86 Thread Safe 5.4
  - get the PHP source matching the binary version from above, e.g. VC9 x86 Thread Safe 5.4
  - get the WinBinder source code

Creating the Project:
---------------------

  1. create the project:
     either create a new Visual C++ project, or import from existing source
    - make your new project a "Win32 Project", call it php_winbinder, or pick any name you like
    - select "DLL" as application type

  - change default C++ options:
    - right click your project and select "Properties"
    - under "Configuration Properties" select "General"
        - set "Character Set" to "Use Multi-Byte Character Set"
    
    - under "Configuration Properties" select "C/C++", and there select "General"
        - set "Debug Information Format" to "Program Database (/Zi)""
        - set "Detect 64-bit Portability Issues" to "No"

    - under "Configuration Properties" select "C/C++", and there select "Code Generation"
        - set "Enable String Pooling" to "Yes (/GF)"
        - set "Enable Minimal Rebuild" to "No"
        - set "Basic Runtime Checks" to "Default"
        - set "Runtime Library" to "Multi-threaded Debug (/MTd)"

  - set the include path:
    - again, under "Configuration Properties" select "C/C++", and there select "General"
        - set the include path as following (adapting to your case)
            - C:\path\to\php\source\main
            - C:\path\to\php\source\Zend
            - C:\path\to\php\source\TSRM
            - C:\path\to\php\source\regex
            - C:\path\to\php\source
            - C:\path\to\php\source\ext\standard

  - set the Preprocessor Definitions:
    - again, under "Configuration Properties" select "C/C++", and there select "Preprocessor"
        - add the following definitions
            - ZEND_DEBUG=0
            - ZTS=1
            - ZEND_WIN32
            - PHP_WIN32

  - set the Linker Options:
    - under "Configuration Properties" select "Linker", and there select "General"
        - set "Additional Library Directories" to C:\path\to\php\binary\dev

    - under "Configuration Properties" select "Linker", and there select "Input"
        - add "php5.lib" (for non-thred-safe version) or "php5ts.lib" (for thread-safe version) to "Additional Dependecies"

  - edit stdafx.h:
    - replace the contents of stdafx.h with the following, if it does not match already:  
    \#pragma once  
    /* PHP Extension headers */  
    /* include zend win32 config first */  
    \#include "zend_config.w32.h"  
    /* include standard header */  
    \#include "php.h"

  You may now try to compile the extension. When successful, it is located in the folder "Debug" of your Visual Studio project.

  - However, it's more likely, that you run into some errors like:

      - fatal error C1083: "../main/config.w32.h": No such file or directory
          - open a Visual Studio command prompt and change into you PHP source directory
          - run the command "buildconf.bat"
          - run the command "cscript /nologo configure.js"

      - great, now I get "ERROR: bison is required"
          - either get bison, or open "configure.js" and comment out the following line ...
              ERROR('bison is required')
            ... and re-run "cscript /nologo configure.js"
              
      - fatal error C1853: something about pre-compiled headers
          - again, under "Configuration Properties" select "C/C++", and there select "Precompiled Headers"
              - set "Use Precompiled Headers" to "Do not use precompiled headers"

      - error C2466: cannot allocate an array of constant size 0
          - go to "C:\path\to\php\source\main" and open "config.w32.h"
          - comment out the following lines  
            \#ifndef \_WIN64  
            \#define _USE\_32BIT\_TIME\_T 1  
            \#endif  
            \#define HAVE\_STDLIB\_H 1  

      - error LNK2005: **** already defined in %%%%%
          - delete files automatically generated by Visual Studio from the project, i.e. stdafx.cpp and dllmain.cpp (maybe more?)

      - fatal error LNK1000: Internal error during IncrBuildImage
          - update your Visual Studio, LNK1000 may happen due to a bug
          - under "Configuration Properties" select "Linker", and there select "General"
              - set "activate incrementel linking" to "No"
